        <p>There once was a boy who grew bored while watching over the village sheep.
             He wanted to make things more exciting. So, he yelled out that he saw a wolf chasing the sheep.
              All the villagers came running to drive the wolf away. However, they saw no wolf. 
              The boy was amused, but the villagers were not. At sunset, the
               villagers looked for the boy. He had not returned with their sheep. They found him crying. </p>

        <p>The Greek king Midas did a good deed for a Satyr. This prompted Dionysus, the god of wine, to grant
             him a wish. Midas asked for everything he touched to turn to gold. Dionysus’ warned him not to do so,
              but Midas could not be swayed. Midas excitedly started touching everything and turning them into gold. 
              Soon, he became hungry. But he couldn’t eat anything because even his food turned to gold. His beloved 
            daughter saw him in distress and ran to hug him. However, she, too, turned to gold. He realised
             then the golden touch was not a blessing.</p>

        <p>A hungry fox once looked everywhere for food. He couldn’t find anything until he stumbled upon a 
            farmer’s wall. He saw big, purple, juicy grapes. He jumped as high as possible to reach the grapes.
             No matter how many times he tried, he failed. Finally, he gave up and went home, thinking to himself that the grapes must have been sour anyway.

        <p>In the desert existed a rose and a cactus. The beautiful rose would take every opportunity to insult 
            the cactus. The other plants tried to defend the cactus, but the rose was too obsessed with its own looks.
            There was no water during a particularly hot summer. The rose started to wither away. But the cactus had 
            become a source of water for sparrows.The rose asked the cactus for water, and the nice cactus readily agreed.</p>

        <p>An old owl would observe incidents happening around his oak tree every day. The more things he saw, the
        less he would speak. He heard people talking and sharing stories as well. The old owl had seen
         so much and heard all kinds of stories. All of these experiences helped the owl to become wiser day by day</p>
